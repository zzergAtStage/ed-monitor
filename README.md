# Overview

`ed-monitor` is a sophisticated desktop/server/api application developed in Java that has evolved
from a simple Swing-based interface to a comprehensive solution incorporating 
file monitoring, user notifications, and persistent market data management. 
This project reflects the progressive enhancement of Java application and its capabilities, 
integrating popular frameworks and adhering to established architectural patterns
to ensure resilience and scalability.

# Features

* File Monitoring: Utilizes Java NIO's WatchService API to efficiently monitor directory and file changes, 
including creation, modification, and deletion events. This allows for real-time tracking of log-files activities.

* User Notifications: Implements a robust notification system that alerts users to specific events or
changes within the application. This feature enhances user engagement and responsiveness to critical updates.

* Persistent Market Data Management: Incorporates mechanisms for the persistent storage and retrieval 
of market data, ensuring data integrity and availability across sessions. This is particularly beneficial 
for applications requiring reliable data persistence.

* Modular Architecture: Designed with a modular approach, facilitating maintainability and extensibility. 
This architecture supports the seamless integration of additional features and components as the application evolves.

## Version updates
* **0.1.0**:
  - Reworked core systems, decoupled `ed-monitor-swing` from Spring, introduced 
[FileReadStrategy.java](ed-monitor-swing/src/main/java/com/zergatstage/monitor/service/readers/FileReadStrategy.java) for file monitoring,
  - added commodity tracker, match with docked market data, highlight required and presented commodities
  - added balanced ground of truth for cargo bay values tracking
  - ðŸ‘‰ Server mode for `ed-monitor-swing` is currently not supported, but can be implemented in future releases.
